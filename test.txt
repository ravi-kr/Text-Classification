"""I was at the premiere and it was awesome don't understand the hate it might be the same story but it still has little changes that I can live with that it was beautiful and I thought it was a film location not by a computer it feels like real life. Jon you did it once again like the jungle book. Go see it you will laugh you will definitely cry and you will cheer."""
